# Yarn-Subscription-Suggestion
Create a GUI that gives users a quiz about their needs for a yarn and/or fiber subscription service and then gives users the 5 highest rated subscription boxes based on the user data.

The end goal is a program that asks questions, such as budget, crafts (spinning, crochet, knitting, as a multiple choice), hand-dyed, experience level, if you want patterns, if you want supplies, project type, make a rank of: low price, luxury yarns, variety, extras then provide yarn subscription boxes - with images and links included - that most fit in with users criteria.

Currently planning to use PyQt5 for GUI and read a CSV file with the yarn subscription information and create a dictionary with name value pairs of Yarn Subscription and Ranking.
